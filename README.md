# Silverstripe docker container
Basic docker container for Silverstripe 4 with PHP 7. Does not include database;

# Goals
* Nothing but Docker installed on Developers machines
* No missing dependencies for Silverstripe development
* No configuration of php.ini file required by Developers

# What this isn't
* A security harderend environment to run a production site on.
* A "out the box" ready to-go Silverstripe install. You'll still need to run composer etc
